#Oystercard in Ruby

This is an attempt to refresh my basic Ruby skills by building an oystercard system with TDD in Ruby.

**The user stories used in building this app are as follows:**
```
In order to use public transport
As a customer
I want money on my card
```
```
In order to keep using public transport
As a customer
I want to add money to my card
```
```
In order to protect my money from theft or loss
As a customer
I want a maximum limit (of Â£90) on my card
```
```
In order to pay for my journey
As a customer
I need my fare deducted from my card
```
```
In order to get through the barriers.
As a customer
I need to touch in and out.
```
